# Issues
### What can i work on
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See 
[Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) for more information. We assign issues to specific contributors, although you are more than welcome to open a PR with a fix if you find an issue to work on.

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem/bug or think that some changes are needed , search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

##### Issue reporting guidelines
•	 When describing issues try to phrase your issue in terms of the behavior you think needs changing rather than the code you think needs changing.

•	If reporting a bug, then try to include a pull request with a failing test case. This will help us quickly identify if there is a valid issue, and make sure that it gets fixed more quickly if there is one.

•	Closing an issue doesn't necessarily mean the end of a discussion. If you believe your issue has been closed incorrectly, explain why and we'll consider if it needs to be reopened.

### Issue template
• **Title**
  Must be clear, concise, and accurately describe what the issue is about.

• **Description**
  Must include a clear explanation about the reasons for doing the work. Preferably in the form of a user story
  that clearly mentions the stakeholders involved and their wishes.

• **Acceptance criteria**
  Must be a list of measurable achievements that indicate the work in the issue is done.
